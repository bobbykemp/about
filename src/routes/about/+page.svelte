		I am a highly organized individual who requires little supervision to get a job done. I am very
		comfortable working in highly diverse teams of various skill levels.

	<p>
		I have full-stack web development experience including writing back-end web applications/REST
		APIs with the Django, Django-REST, and Express frameworks, as well as writing modern front-end
		applications and Progressive Web Apps using React and Svelte.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have experience with various programming languages including Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, and
		Rust. Moreover, I am very familiar with the process of designing systems from an
		object-oriented, test-driven perspective. I am comfortable and have experience working in all
		major operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS). I am experienced in using Git for version
		control. I am experienced in using Docker and Docker Compose for developing easily replicable
		and composable container-based software systems. I also have experience with modern CI/CD
		practices using Jenkins.
